            No! The Presentations in KCDs cover a wide variety of topics around
            open source and cloud-native technologies. A very basic awareness of
            Cloud and Containers is sufficient to benefit from attending KCD
            Dhaka. Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and
            run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as
            public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes,
            microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs
            exemplify this approach.

            Kubernetes Community Days (KCDs) are community-organized,
            not-for-profit events. Organizing a large-scale, in-person event
            like KCD Dhaka involves considerable cost. Sponsors provide partial
            financial support for the event. The remaining cost is covered by
            tickets.

            KCDs are the second favorite event from CNCF, just behind KubeCon.
            In 2022, CNCF supported 16 KCDs across 14 countries, with more than
            6500 attendees. The Speakers cover business issues, tools,
            processes, automation and cloud strategy. Many talks will be about
            how companies relied on open source technologies to modernize Apps
            and Infrastructure. As an attendee you get to connect and
            collaborate with Software Engineers, DevOps Professionals, SREs,
            Cloud Developers, End-users, Vendors, Industry experts and Thought
            leaders.
